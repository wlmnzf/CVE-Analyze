CAPEC-60,124,The adversary must be able to manipulate some piece of the shared resource either directly or indirectly and the other users of the data must accept the changed data as valid.

CAPEC-73,13,Input data used in an environment variable is not validated properly.
CAPEC-74,13,The variables encapsulation is not done properly. For instance setting a variable as public in a class makes it visible and an adversary may attempt to manipulate that variable.
CAPEC-75,130,The target must accept service requests from the attacker and the adversary must be able to control the resource allocation associated with this request to be in excess of the normal allocation.

CAPEC-122,162,The targeted site must not validate the hidden fields with backend processing.

CAPEC-124,164,An adversary needs mobile phone numbers to initiate contact with the victim.
CAPEC-125,164,An adversary needs to correctly guess the entity with which the victim does business and impersonate it. Most of the time phishers just use the most popular banks/services and send out their hooks to many potential victims.

CAPEC-136,173,The adversary must convince the victim into performing the decoy action.
CAPEC-137,173,The adversary must have the means to control a user's interface to present them with a decoy action as well as the actual malicious action.

The Flash application must fail to sanitize such parameters against malicious manipulation. The victim must follow a crafted link created by the attacker.

CAPEC-146,18,The target client software must allow the execution of scripts generated by remote hosts.
CAPEC-147,180,"The target must apply access controls, but incorrectly configure them. However, not all incorrect configurations can be exploited by an attacker. If the incorrect configuration applies too little security to some functionality, then the attacker may be able to exploit it if the access control would be the only thing preventing an attacker's access and it no longer does so.

CAPEC-178,204,The cache must be inadequately protected against attacker access.

CAPEC-180,207,"The targeted server must assume the client performs important actions to protect the server or the server functionality. For example, the server may assume the client filters outbound traffic or that the client performs all price calculations correctly.

CAPEC-689,80,The application's UTF-8 decoder accepts and interprets illegal UTF-8 characters or non-shortest format of UTF-8 encoding.
CAPEC-690,80,Input filtering and validating is not done properly leaving the door open to harmful characters for the target host.
CAPEC-691,81,Target server software must be a HTTP server that performs web logging.

CAPEC-696,86,Target software must be a client that allows scripting communication from remote hosts.
CAPEC-697,87,The forcibly browseable pages or accessible resources must be discoverable and improperly protected.
CAPEC-698,88,User controllable input used as part of commands to the underlying operating system.
CAPEC-699,89,Vulnerable DNS software or improperly protected hosts file or router that can be poisoned
CAPEC-700,89,A website that handles sensitive information but does not use a secure connection and a certificate that is valid is also prone to pharming
CAPEC-701,9,The target host exposes a command-line utility to the user.
CAPEC-702,9,The command-line utility exposed by the target host has a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be exploited.
CAPEC-703,90,"The attacker must have direct access to the target server in order to successfully mount a reflection attack. An intermediate entity, such as a router or proxy, that handles these exchanges on behalf of the attacker inhibits the attackers' ability to attack the authentication protocol."
CAPEC-704,92,The attacker can manipulate the value of an integer variable utilized by the target host.
CAPEC-705,92,The target host does not do proper range checking on the variable before utilizing it.
CAPEC-706,92,"When the integer variable is incremented or decremented to an out of range value, it gets a very different value (e.g. very small or negative number)"
CAPEC-707,93,The target host is logging the action and data of the user.
CAPEC-708,93,The target host insufficiently protects access to the logs or logging mechanisms.
CAPEC-709,94,There are two components communicating with each other.
CAPEC-710,94,An attacker is able to identify the nature and mechanism of communication between the two target components.
CAPEC-711,94,An attacker can eavesdrop on the communication between the target components.
CAPEC-712,94,Strong mutual authentication is not used between the two target components yielding opportunity for attacker interposition.
CAPEC-713,94,The communication occurs in clear (not encrypted) or with insufficient and spoofable encryption.
CAPEC-714,95,A client program connecting to a web service can read the WSDL to determine what functions are available on the server.
CAPEC-715,95,The target host exposes vulnerable functions within its WSDL interface.
CAPEC-716,96,An application requires access to external libraries.
CAPEC-717,96,An attacker has the privileges to block application access to external libraries.
CAPEC-718,97,The target software utilizes some sort of cryptographic algorithm.
CAPEC-719,97,An underlying weaknesses exists either in the cryptographic algorithm used or in the way that it was applied to a particular chunk of plaintext.
CAPEC-720,97,The encryption algorithm is known to the attacker.
CAPEC-721,97,An attacker has access to the ciphertext.
CAPEC-722,98,An attacker needs to have a way to initiate contact with the victim. Typically that will happen through e-mail.
CAPEC-723,98,An attacker needs to correctly guess the entity with which the victim does business and impersonate it. Most of the time phishers just use the most popular banks/services and send out their hooks to many potential victims.
CAPEC-724,98,An attacker needs to have a sufficiently compelling call to action to prompt the user to take action.
CAPEC-725,98,The replicated website needs to look extremely similar to the original website and the URL used to get to that website needs to look like the real URL of the said business entity.
