{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0006-T1555-T1555.003", "TTP_name": "Credentials from Web Browsers", "Description": "Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading files specific to the target browser.[1] Web browsers commonly save credentials such as website usernames and passwords so that they do not need to be entered manually in the future. Web browsers typically store the credentials in an encrypted format within a credential store; however, methods exist to extract plaintext credentials from web browsers.For example, on Windows systems, encrypted credentials may be obtained from Google Chrome by reading a database file, AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data and executing a SQL query: SELECT action_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins;. The plaintext password can then be obtained by passing the encrypted credentials to the Windows API function CryptUnprotectData, which uses the victim’s cached logon credentials as the decryption key.[2]Adversaries have executed similar procedures for common web browsers such as FireFox, Safari, Edge, etc.[3][4] Windows stores Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge credentials in Credential Lockers managed by the Windows Credential Manager.Adversaries may also acquire credentials by searching web browser process memory for patterns that commonly match credentials.[5]After acquiring credentials from web browsers, adversaries may attempt to recycle the credentials across different systems and/or accounts in order to expand access. This can result in significantly furthering an adversary's objective in cases where credentials gained from web browsers overlap with privileged accounts (e.g. domain administrator).", "Property": {"ID": "T1555.003", "Sub-technique of": "T1555", "Tactic": "Credential Access", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Permissions Required": "User", "Contributors": "Barry Shteiman, Exabeam; RedHuntLabs, @redhuntlabs; Ryan Benson, Exabeam; Sylvain Gil, Exabeam", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "12 February 2020", "Last Modified": "15 February 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0331": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0331", "Agent Tesla", "Agent Tesla can gather credentials from a number of browsers.[6]"], "G0130": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0130", "Ajax Security Team", "Ajax Security Team has used FireMalv custom-developed malware, which collected passwords from the Firefox browser storage.[7]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has stolen user's saved passwords from Chrome.[8]"], "G0022": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0022", "APT3", "APT3 has used tools to dump passwords from browsers.[9]"], "G0064": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0064", "APT33", "APT33 has used a variety of publicly available tools like LaZagne to gather credentials.[10][11]"], "G0067": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0067", "APT37", "APT37 has used a credential stealer known as ZUMKONG that can harvest usernames and passwords stored in browsers.[12]"], "S0344": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0344", "Azorult", "Azorult can steal credentials from the victim's browser.[13]"], "S0093": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0093", "Backdoor.Oldrea", "Some Backdoor.Oldrea samples contain a publicly available Web browser password recovery tool.[14]"], "S0089": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0089", "BlackEnergy", "BlackEnergy has used a plug-in to gather credentials from web browsers including FireFox, Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer.[15][16]"], "S0657": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0657", "BLUELIGHT", "BLUELIGHT can collect passwords stored in web browers, including Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome, and Naver Whale.[17]"], "S0484": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0484", "Carberp", "Carberp's passw.plug plugin can gather passwords saved in Opera, Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, and Chrome.[18]"], "S0631": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0631", "Chaes", "Chaes can steal login credentials and stored financial information from the browser.[19]"], "S0144": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0144", "ChChes", "ChChes steals credentials stored inside Internet Explorer.[20]"], "S0492": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0492", "CookieMiner", "CookieMiner can steal saved usernames and passwords in Chrome as well as credit card credentials.[21]"], "S0050": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0050", "CosmicDuke", "CosmicDuke collects user credentials, including passwords, for various programs including Web browsers.[22]"], "S0115": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0115", "Crimson", "Crimson contains a module to steal credentials from Web browsers on the victim machine.[23][24]"], "S0367": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0367", "Emotet", "Emotet has been observed dropping browser password grabber modules.
